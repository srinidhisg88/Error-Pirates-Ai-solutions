# Error Pirates - Supply Chain Intelligence Platform
Hackfest 2025 | Logistics Hermes Track

## 🏴‍☠️ Project Overview
Error Pirates is an integrated AI-powered solution that addresses critical challenges in modern supply chains:

- Limited visibility across stages
- Poor coordination among stakeholders
- Inefficient planning

Our platform combines multiple AI technologies into a cohesive system that provides end-to-end supply chain intelligence and automation.

## 🧠 Key Components
1. **Demand Forecasting Engine**
   - ML-based forecasting system that predicts inventory needs across the supply chain
   - Combines time-series analysis with external factors to optimize stock levels and reduce waste

2. **Exception Handler Agent**
   - Intelligent agent that monitors supply chain operations in real-time
   - Automatically identifies issues, resolves standard problems, and escalates complex situations

3. **Integration Dashboard**
   - Unified visualization and control center
   - Brings together insights from all AI components
   - Provides a single interface for supply chain management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Docker
- Node.js 18+ (for dashboard)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/error-pirates-hackfest.git
cd error-pirates-hackfest
```

2. Set up the environment:
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Launch the dashboard:
```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm start
```

## 📊 Demo Data
For demonstration purposes, we've included sample datasets in the `shared-utils/data` directory. These datasets simulate real-world supply chain scenarios and can be used to showcase the platform's capabilities.

## 🔄 Integration Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Supply chain data is collected from various sources and normalized
2. **Demand Forecasting**: ML models predict future inventory requirements
3. **Exception Monitoring**: The agent continuously analyzes operations for anomalies
4. **Automated Resolution**: Standard issues are resolved without human intervention
5. **Visualization**: All insights and actions are displayed on the integrated dashboard
